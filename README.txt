This activity module allows final grades from other
courses to be used as activity grade in a course.

If you are using Moodle version before 2.8, you'll
have to patch your Moodle with a very
little patch that you can find on the link below

https://github.com/danielneis/moodle/compare/MOODLE_25_STABLE...MDL-40697.diff

After applying the patch, install the module as usual.
