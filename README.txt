This activity module allows final grades from other
courses to be used as activity grade in a course.

This requires that you patch your Moodle with a very
little patch until MDL-40697 is accepted in mainline.

To get the patch for Moodle 2.5 go to the link below
https://github.com/danielneis/moodle/compare/MOODLE_25_STABLE...MDL-40697.diff


After applying the patch, install the module as usual.
